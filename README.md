# Solution fo the "pokedex" task

### This is [a link](https://noamgolani.github.io/pokedex/dist/) to the github-pages of my solution.

**Pokedex** is a webapp, for looking up Pokemon's and viewing their info. Using the [poke-api](https://pokeapi.co/).

### Main features:

- Search bar - type a name or an id for a pokemon. When clicking "Search" it will make a request for the _poke-api_
- Pokeon toast - each pokemon is displayed with a toast. Including its: weight, height, picture ant types.
- "The reveal" - when hovering over a toast the pokemon will reveal itself to the user.
- Types - clicking on a pokemon's type will open a dropdown displaying all the pokemons with the same type. Clicking on a pokemon will add it to the page
- Error alerts - if an error hapens the page will display an error at the right buttom of the screen. It will disapear after 5 seconds.
- Autocomplete - when you start typing, you will be suggested with clickble pokemons containing your current search value.
